/*
 - Start from minimum requirements --> init
 - Think about what I have in order to provide url but use some kind of collaborator URLSession for example (HTTP client)
 - But I don't have URL yet so, maybe need to go from other direction(different angle) -->
 - We can provide client trough constructor, property, method injection, but there is another ways
 - And we want to get rid of singleton --> global shared instance
 - The smell is that we have a subclassing and we can use composition instead of the inheritance
 - We can remove shared instance and have abstract class
 - Since the protocol is better as abstraction, we can remove class keyword
